Revision history for roleplay

roleplay v0.8     Wed Jan 16 11:51:00 GMT+2 2007 [askh@opera.com]

    - Roleplay now passes all tests in the Perl6::Roles test suite. :)

    - Runtime composition seems to work now.

    - Now does conflict resolution, summation of roles, roles are not
      allowed to inherit from other roles (only use them as roles), requires

    - does() now works properly. It was really incomplete before.

    - has_role(instance, role, **kwargs) is now has_role(cls, *args,
      **kwargs) to summate multiple roles at a time.

    - Changed license to GPLv2. I ported the Perl6::Roles unit tests to
      python and they are GPL, so I'll change to be sure.

roleplay v0.12    Mon Jan 14 09:26:00 GMT+2 2007 [askh@opera.com]

    - Now dies on conflict

    - apply flattened some methods from the role base class that shouldn't
      be there. fixed.

    - does() now traverses the method resolution order.

    - looks like the dream of using a role in the class definition is
      shattered :( The new syntax is:

        class Foo(object):
            def hello(self):
                return "hello world"

        does(Foo, Role1, Role2, Role3, ..., RoleN)

    - Just bolds out the fact that this is an alpha release.

roleplay v0.1    Sat Jan 12 09:26:00 GMT+2 2007 [askh@opera.com]
